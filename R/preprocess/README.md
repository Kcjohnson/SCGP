These scripts are **not essential** for preprocessing, but rather they relate to quality assessment or data collection. There are likely to be many files specified that cannot be found in this repository. This code is being maintained here largely as a reference point for the Verhaak laboratory and for parties interested in how some of the sequencing metrics were generated.
